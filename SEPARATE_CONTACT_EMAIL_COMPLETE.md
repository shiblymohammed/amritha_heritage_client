## 🔍 How It Works

### Before (Not Working)
```typescript
// Contact.tsx
import { sendContactEmail } from "../../services/emailService";
// ❌ Problem: emailService only has 2 template slots
// ❌ Already used by Booking + Reservation
```

### After (Working)
```typescript
// Contact.tsx
import { sendContactEmail } from "../../services/emailService2";
// ✅ Solution: emailService2 uses separate account
// ✅ Has its own template slot for contact form
```

## 📧 Email Flow

### Booking Email
```
User books room → Booking.tsx → emailService.ts → 
Account 1 → Booking Template → Admin receives email
```

### Reservation Email
```
User reserves table → StickyCart.tsx → emailService.ts → 
Account 1 → Reservation Template → Admin receives email
```

### Contact Email
```
User submits contact form → Contact.tsx → emailService2.ts → 
Account 2 → Contact Template → Admin receives email
```
